# advent of code 2018

solutions for the [advent of code (2018)](http://adventofcode.com/2018).

-----

all of my code is located in the `code/` folder, and my input files are located in the `input/` folder.

in addition to the solutions for each day (located in `code/{day}/solution.py`), there are
two utility files: `aoc.py`, and `utils.py`. `aoc.py` contains functions specific to
advent of code, i.e. opening input files for a specific day. `utils.py` contains helpful functions
that i've come across on the web or created myself.
